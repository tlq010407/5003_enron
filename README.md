### Database download

In order to download the database, run the first cell in jupter notebook, the database will download
```python
import requests
url = "https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/enron_mail_20150507.tar.gz"
filename = "../enron_mail_20150507.tar.gz"
with open(filename, "wb") as f:
    r = requests.get(url)
    f.write(r.content)
```
and unzip automatically.

tfile.extractall(".")
tfile.close()
```
After downloading the database, it will show "You're ready to go!", which named "maildir".

You can make this cell to command after you download the database successfully.

### Convert Enron database to .csv file

Read files' content in maildir files, and create a .csv file named "enron_emails.csv".

The .csv file will contain two columns -- "file", "message"

1. file: store the directly name of file
2. message: store the content of the email that we read from file

After run the cell to read the files and write into .csv file, a "enron_emails.csv" will be autogenerated under the same folder of our raw database.

**_The "enron_emails.csv" file will be automatically saved into parent folder_**

### Data Preprocessing

After data cleaning and preprocessing, it will generate a new csv file called "enron_emails_cleaned.csv", both ML_NLP_classification and Sentiment Analysis have to first import this cleaned enron email datasets into code then proceeded to next procedure.
