### Database download

In order to download the database, run the first cell in jupter notebook, the database will download and unzip automatically.

After downloading the database, it will show "You're ready to go!", which named "maildir".

You can make this cell to command after you download the database successfully.

### Convert Enron database to .csv file

Read files' content in maildir files, and create a .csv file named "enron_emails.csv".

The .csv file will contain two columns -- "file", "message"

1. file: store the directly name of file
2. message: store the content of the email that we read from file

After run the cell to read the files and write into .csv file, a "enron_emails.csv" will be autogenerated under the same folder of our raw database.

**_The "enron_emails.csv" file will be automatically saved into parent folder_**

### Data Preprocessing

After data cleaning and preprocessing, it will generate a new csv file called "enron_emails_cleaned.csv", both ML_NLP_classification and Sentiment Analysis have to first import this cleaned enron email datasets into code then proceeded to next procedure.

### To upload or reload the code into github

**Only upload the code DO NOT UPLOAD THE DATABASE AND .CSV FILE**
